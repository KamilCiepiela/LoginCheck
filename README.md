This is an automation testing script to verify logging process of a https://www.aptekagemini.pl/user/loginUser web page. 

!!!This script was created for personal use and cannot be reproduced or changed without author's permission.!!!

This automation script should performed on Chrome (ver. at least 80.0.3987.149 (64-bit)) with proper chromedriver.exe file. 

In IntelliJ IDEA's new project select an option to clone the repository (no password needed). The repo would be cloned 
to your hard drive. In line 20 you need to change relative path to the chromedriver implemented in the cloned project 
(in my case it would be C:/Users/Kamil/IdeaProjects/chromedriver.exe). Then click green PLAY button next in line 31 
to run first test, in line 110 to start second test or in line 12 to start both of them.
